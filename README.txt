- Most of the data preprocessing part is in Data Cleaning folder
- In Data Cleaning folder, data is cleaned and different files are merged. The files we get are cleaned_datafile.csv and cleaned_datafile_2.csv
- Question 1,2,3,4,5,8 require cleaned_datafile.csv
- Question 6,9 require cleaned_datafile2.csv
- libraries like scipy, pandas must be installed in order to run these files
- In Question 3 and 4, p_value for all the states is greater than 0.1, therefore for no state or union territory, ratios are significantly
  different between (male and females) or (urban and rural)
